## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of the analysis is to develop a model using the historical data in order to identify and distinguish between credit worthy and high risk loan applicants. Finally, once developed, the modelâ€™s performance is assessed for potential use on future loan applicant data.

This analysis tool uses a dataset of historical lending activity from a lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers based on factors such as loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt-to-income ratio, number of accounts held, number of derogatory marks, total debt, and, lastly, loan status.

The stages of the machine learning process analysis I utilized are:
  -  Data Collection and Preparation
  -  Model Selection
  -  Model Training
  -  Model Prediction
  -  Model Utilization

## Results

Machine Learning Model 1 - Logistic Regression:
  -  Accuracy: 0.9442676901753825
  -  Precision: 1.0 / 0.87
  -  Recall scores: 1.0 / 0.89

Machine Learning Model 2 - Logistic Regression w/ ReSampled Data:
  -  Accuracy: 0.9959744975744975
  -  Precision: 1.0 / 0.87
  -  Recall scores: 1.0 / 1.0

## Summary
Both precision for the logistic regression model, original and fit with oversampled data, were great at detecting healthy loans (1.0) and less accurate at detecting high-risk loans (0.87).

Based on the findings of Machine Learning Model 1 compared to Machine Learning Model 2, I considered recommending using Model 2, Logistic Regression with Resampled Data but I cannot overlook the fact that this dataset is severely imbalanced:  
  -  0 (credit-worthy)	75036
  -  1 (credit risk)	2500

And therefore I recommend further supervised machine learning modeling on a larger and more balanced dataset.
